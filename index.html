                <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>"Furry Fosters" is taking care of dogs in behalf of owners, who might be too old or diseased to care for their furry friends any longer. 
                    We're also working with animal protection organizations, which operate all over the globe, to ensure that animals are living in the right conditions and get treated right.
                    Therefore we're looking for experienced Dog owners, who know about the duties owning an animal involves. Dogs have needs, too! A lot of our animals have been mistreated and need 
                    an understanding, patient environment. But take a look yourself!
